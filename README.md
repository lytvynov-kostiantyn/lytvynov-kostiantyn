### Summary

Python developer with an engineering background and strong analytical skills. I have completed certification programs
in "Python Developer from CyberBionic Systematics" (participant in the "IT Generation" program) and "Computer Science
for Web Programming by HarvardX." The certification training provided practical experience in developing web
applications
using the following technologies: Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, MySQL, and Git.

I am constantly striving for self-improvement, learning new technologies, and enhancing my skills. Currently, I am
